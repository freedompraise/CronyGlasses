## My Journey with CronyGlasses

CronyGlasses started as a Django FullStack app in 2022, but due to responsive issues and deployment challenges, I transitioned it to React and Tailwind after learning these technologies. It's an E-commerce store built using React with a Supabase database, and deployed on Vercel.

The app uses the `useContext` hook for handling carts and real-time updates, including order history.

### If I Had to Do It Again:

- Define color variables for light and dark themes
- Write tests for major functionalities
- Separate concerns if handling the backend
- Consider using a larger library like Redux for state management
- Implement loading pages
